# Race
A character's *Race* is the species that serves as the statistical foundation for creating that character.

*Racial traits* are passive abilities and modifiers available to the character upon creation.

*Racial modifiers* should be used as the default attribute modifiers for NPC characters of that race.
When creating a player character, add these modifiers to the WIZARDS attributes as they are rolled.

# Xeno Races
TBD


# Hybrids
Hybrid characters are created from a combination of one or more races.

To create a hybrid race:
- Use the average of the two races' racial attribute modifiers, rounding down.
- Start without access to racial traits.

When a character with a hybrid origin is able to [level-up](level-up.md), 
they may instead "unlock" a racial trait from one of their constituent races.
The traits from each hybridized race must be unlocked in the order they are listed,
as if each trait had as a prerequisite all previously-listed traits.

*For example, a half-giant character must unlock "Lose Advantage on Clash Saves" 
before it is able to take "`+10` to Life".*
