# Race
A character's *Race* is the species that serves as the statistical foundation for creating that character.

*Racial traits* are passive abilities and modifiers available to the character upon creation.

*Racial modifiers* should be used as the default attribute modifiers for NPC characters of that race.
When creating a player character, add these modifiers to the WIZARDS attributes as they are rolled.


# Humanoid Races

## HUMAN (Default)

### Racial traits:
- `+1"` to any attribute (chosen after rolling WIZARDS)
- `+1"` to any attribute (chosen after rolling WIZARDS)

### Racial modifiers:
| Attribute | Mod |
|-----------|-----|
|W|+0|
|I|+0|
|Z|+0|
|A|+0|
|R|+0|
|D|+0|
|S|+0|


# HYBRID Races
At the DM's discretion, *Hybrid* characters may be created from a combination of two or more races.
These races become the character's *Ancestral Races*. <br>
*(Note: These are referred to as "Ancestral Races" regardless of how the campaign explains the existence of the hybrid.)

To create a character with a hybrid race:
- Use the average of the Ancestral Races' racial attribute modifiers, rounding down.
- Start without access to racial traits.

Whenever a character with a hybrid race is able to [level-up](level-up.md), 
they may instead "unlock" a racial trait from one of their ancestral races.
The traits from each race must be unlocked in the order they are listed. <br>
*For example, a half-GIANT (half-HUMAN) character must unlock "Lose Advantage on Clash Saves" 
before it is able to take "`+10` to Life".*
