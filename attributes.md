# WIZARDS Attributes
Each character has a set of attributes to represent their overall capability and talent,
which can be remembered using the acronym "W.I.Z.A.R.D.S."

|Attribute|Description|

|**Zest**| Charisma and social appeal; Force of personality; Flair |

|**Resilience**| Stamina and endurance; Resistance to external effects; Sturdiness |
|**Dexterity**| Manual control; Precision |
|**Strength**| Physical might; Capacity for raw muscular force |

### Equpment/Ability restrictions
Attribute values are used to limit the abilities and equipment available to the character,
representing the character's practical capacity to use the ability or object.

### Value range
WIZARDS attribute values can range from 0-10 by default. 
Modifiers to an attribute value (e.g., from abilities or equipment)
cannot increase it above the maximum or decrease it below the minimum of this range.

### Modifiers
WIZARDS attributes also determine the default modifiers a character uses for Narrative (d20) rolls.
These may be referred to as a character's WIZARDS modifiers, 
or individually as the character's "\[Attribute\] modifier" (e.g., "Zest modifier").
