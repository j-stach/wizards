# WIZARDS Attributes
Each character has a set of attributes to represent their overall capability and talent,
which can be remembered using the acronym ***W.I.Z.A.R.D.S.***

|Attribute|Capabilities covered|
|---------|-----------|
|***Wisdom***| `Intuition` `Insight` `Depth of knowledge` |
|***Intelligence***| `Complex analysis` `Abstract understanding` |
|***Zest***| `Charisma` `Force of personality` `Flair` |
|***Agility***| `Mobility` `Reactivity` `Balance` |
|***Resilience***| `Stamina` `Endurance` `Natural immunity` |
|***Dexterity***| `Manual control` `Precision` |
|***Strength***| `Sturdiness` `Raw muscular force` |

#### Restrictions
WIZARDS attributes are used to limit the [abilities](abilities.md) 
and [equipment](equipment.md) available to the character,
representing the character's practical capacity to use the ability or object.

#### Value range
Attribute values can range from **0 - 10** by default. 
Modifiers to an attribute value (e.g., from abilities or equipment)
cannot increase it above the maximum or decrease it below the minimum of this range.

#### Modifiers
Attributes also determine the default modifiers a character uses for Narrative (d20) rolls.
These may be referred to as a character's WIZARDS modifiers, 
or individually as the character's "*Attribute* modifier" (e.g., "Zest modifier").
