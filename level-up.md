# Level Up
A character may *level-up* as it is created, and may do so again at the DM's discretion,
up to a maximum level of 100.

*Note: The pace of gaining levels will be unique to each campaign, 
but should give players time to familiarize themselves while also providing consistent advancement.
A good approach might be to have characters level-up during "downtime" between coherent missions.
(Every 1-3 sessions, or 6-12 hours of consistent play.)*

To level-up, a character may:
- Add a new [ability](abilities.md) (if they meet the WIZARDS requirements)
- Add 5 to their maximum Life or Mana
- Add 1 to any [attribute](attributes.md)
