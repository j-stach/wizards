# Creating a Character

## 1. Race
Choose a [race](race.md) for your character. 

## 2. Attributes
Roll **d10** for each [WIZARDS Attribute](attributes.md), 
adding the character's racial attribute modifiers to the results.

## 3. Reservoirs
**Life** is `30` plus *Resilience* and *Strength* modifiers. <br>
**Mana** is `10` plus *Wisdom* and *Zest* modifiers.


## 4. Level Up
Determine a starting level for the campaign, then [level-up](level-up.md) the character that many times.

### Recommended starting level:
|Lv. |Player|
|----|------|
|0 | New to TTRPG |
|3 | Migrating from another TTRPG |
|5+| Used WIZARDS in a previous campaign |

### Replacing a character:
If a player needs to replace a character that was killed or otherwise removed from the campaign,
they may instead start at the level of their previous character.

**Optional:** *Ignore this sub-rule for a more "hardcore" gameplay experience.*


## 5. Equipment

### > Armor
Each character is created with basic [armor](armor.md) that has no additional ability or effect. 

Choose Armor Class for each Armor Slot.

### > Weapons
Each character is created with both hands equipped.

Choose a [weapon](weapons.md):
- Up to 2 One-Handed weapons
- 1 Two-Handed weapon

### > Storage
A character may start equipped with [storage](storage.md) (e.g., a backpack, belt).

### > Items
If a character is equipped with storage, they may fill all storage slots with basic [items](items.md)
that are representative of their background.

### > Currency
At the DM's discretion, a character may start with [currency](currency.md) 
appropriate to the campaign economy and the character's background. 

The character must have storage capacity for currency they receive.
